        <h3 class='text-center'>Employee Confidentiality</h3>
<h5>Policy brief & purpose</h5>
We designed our company confidentiality policy to explain how we expect our employees to treat confidential information. 
Employees will unavoidably receive and handle personal and private information about clients, partners and our company. 
We want to make sure that this information is well-protected.

<h5>Scope</h5>
This policy affects all employees, including board members, investors, contractors and volunteers, 
who may have access to confidential information.

<h5>Policy elements</h5>
Confidential and proprietary information is secret, valuable, expensive. 
Common examples of confidential information are:

Unpublished financial information

Data of Customers/Partners/Vendors

Data entrusted to our company by external parties

Pricing/marketing and other undisclosed strategies

Employees may have various levels of authorized access to confidential information.

What employees should do:

Lock or secure confidential information at all times

Share confidential documents when they’re no longer needed

Make sure they only view confidential information on secure devices

Only disclose information to other employees when it’s necessary and authorized

Keep confidential documents inside our company’s premises unless it’s absolutely necessary to move them

What employees shouldn’t do:

Use confidential information for any personal benefit or profit

Disclose confidential information to anyone outside of our company

Replicate confidential documents and files and store them on insecure devices

When employees stop working for our company, they’re obliged to return any confidential files and delete them from their personal devices.

Precautionary Measures

We’ll take measures to ensure that confidential information is well protected. We’ll:

Store and lock paper documents

Encrypt electronic information and safeguard databases

Ask employees to sign non-compete and/or non-disclosure agreements (NDAs)

Ask for authorization by senior management to allow employees to access certain confidential information

<h5>Disciplinary Consequences</h5>
Employees who don’t respect our confidentiality policy will face disciplinary and, possibly, legal action.

We’ll investigate every breach of this policy. We’ll terminate any employee who willfully or regularly breaches our 
confidentiality guidelines for personal profit. We may also have to punish any unintentional breach of this policy
 depending on its frequency and seriousness. We’ll terminate employees who repeatedly disregard this policy, even when 
 they do so unintentionally.

This policy is binding even after separation of employment.
